	<h2>How the Technology of Tomorrow Impacts Us Today</h2>

	<h3>by Emilie</h3>

	<p>The so called "technology of tomorrow" is already here today and we don't even know it. Since the beginning of humankind we've been creating tools to make our day to day lives easier. Weapons made out of bones, sticks and rocks to make hunting easier, clay pots and jars to hold materials that can be preserved. It's human nature to reduce our physical input in the activities we involve ourselves in. Our newest tool? Technology. Each year technology always improves and we continue to incorporate it in our everyday lives. But at what cost? Sure, automated cash registers can make checking out at the store easier. Cars and other forms of transportation can make traveling place to place easier than riding on a horse. But what about the cashiers and the horses that don't have jobs anymore? Technology has improved to the point where there are already self driving cars and machines and other technological advances that forces people out of their jobs. What will happen to the workers of America if robots take over everyone's jobs?</p>

	<p>There's no doubt that technology is extremely useful. It's how we're able to send people into space and fly across the world in a matter of hours. But while there are many perks to the recent advancements in technology, there are also repercussions. There are so many people that are unemployed that are able fill the jobs robots are starting to replace. While the money is not always there to pay extra employees, it does beat paying an absurd amount of money for a single machine and repairs it’ll inevitably require when breaks at some point. Short term, having robots replace humans seems like the effective choice since they can complete a job faster and cheaper than a human can. In the long run, humans, while their work may not be perfect or quick, will always be the best fit for a job.</p>

		<p> We are honestly digging ourselves in a deep endless hole. All we are doing is laying of thousands of human workers. Soon robots will control everything and once they have emotion and a brain to think with on their own we are fu**ed!!!! The best thing to do as you said is to just help humans improve their work ethic and keep humans in control.</p>

	<h2>The Things We Use Everyday Can Be Used Against Us</h2>

	<h3>by Emilie</h3>

	<img src="https://technicallyeasy.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cell-phone-tracking.jpg">

	<p>Each year there are thousands of people who have their personal information or identity stolen. In the end, people will blame the internet, certain companies or even technology for these thefts. However, we shouldn't blame technology for having private information being on the internet in the first place. Advancements in technology allow for the option to store our private information for our own convenience, to save money, time and effort. So it's really our own fault that our information gets stolen. We are the ones who put it out there in the first place, leaving our footprints for someone else to follow and eventually find.</p>

	<p>GPS and other tracking systems have significantly improved the lives of many people around the world. However, these devices in our phones and in our cars allow for us to be tracked, whether we want to be or not. GPS can traced to locate you anywhere on Earth while for cell phones service is needed in order to be tracked. Even though it’s very likely that someone working for a cell phone or car company is tracking and keeping record of everywhere we visit, it’s not as likely that information is being used against us...yet.</p>

	<p>Black boxes are commonly known for keeping / storing data for airplanes. But they are also in our cars and most people don't know it. Insurance companies likely have a lot of the data stored in a car's "event data recorder" (EDR) in their systems. It’s hard though for other people, especially police officers, to access this data without a warrant. EDRs store information about speed, braking time, seat belts along other things that are needed to explain how an accident happened.</p>

	<p>The technology we use daily can be used against us at some point. We are tracked using the devices we carry around with us or use daily. But why is this still allowed? None of our information is safe no matter how many times we reassure ourselves. And there’s nothing we can do about it since nobody really cares. Sure, we see on the news how identities are stolen and how emails, messages and other things are leaked. We convince ourselves that something like that is never going to happen to us. But with all of our information being stored, the websites we go on, the people we text, the calls we make, our address and phone numbers, there will be a point in time where that information can be sold and used against us. We know the risks, but we still put our information out in the world anyways. Technology will inevitably be our downfall, but we keep using it and improving it daily. So we're really leading ourselves to our doom.</p>

	<p>I interviwed my mom, whom doesn't want her age disclosed since she thinks she's old, about technology in her youth and how it has changed over her lifetime.</p>

	<p class="seperate"><span class="Em">Emilie</span>: How old were you when you got your first computer?</p>

	<p class="seperate"><span class="Laurie">Laurie</span>: I was somewhere in my 30s.</p>

	<p class="seperate""><span class="Em">Emilie</span>: What was your favorite piece of technology when you were growing up?</p>

	<p class="seperate"><span class="Laurie">Laurie</span>: The regular telephone, there were no cell phones like there are now. I didn't really own technology growing up.</p>

	<p class="seperate"><span class="Em">Emilie</span>: How has technology changed over your lifetime?</p>

	<p class="seperate"><span class="Laurie">Laurie</span>: The creation of cell phones and laptops, we didn't have that. I had a typewriter. Everything makes my life easier now.</p>

	<p class="seperate""><span class="Em">Emilie</span>: Have the changes you've seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society?</p>

	<p class="seperate"><span class="Laurie">Laurie</span>: I would say it has helped. But there are times where people could suffer or lose their jobs because of things they posted. And nothing is gone from the internet forever.</p>

	<p class="seperate"><span class="Em">Emilie</span>: What is your greatest hope for technology in the future? </p>

	<p class="seperate"><span class="Laurie">Laurie</span>: To make my life easier.</p>

	<p class="seperate"><span class="Em">Emilie</span>: What is your greatest fear for technology in the future?</p>

	<p class="seperate"><span class="Laurie">Laurie</span>: That people will become obsessed with it. Also people will start using technology for the wrong reasons.</p>

	<p class="seperate"><span class="Em">Emilie</span>: What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about technology?</p>

	<p class="seperate"><span class="Laurie">Laurie</span>: The biggest lesson you can learn about technology is that be careful with what you share and post online. It can come back to haunt you.</p>

	<p class="seperate"><span class="Em">Emilie</span>: If you could remove a certain type of technology from the world what would it be?</p>

	<p class="seperate"><span class="Laurie">Laurie</span>: Video games, for sure.</p>

		<h3> WOWZEERRRSSSS </h3>
		<h4> Jaseam Smith</h4>
		<p> Yes people send things that they cant take back all the time and these things ruin lives everyday. Stick to video games and listening to music as oppose to sending inapropriate pics and we will be good.</p>
